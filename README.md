## Refactors made:

In order to meet accessibility standards I changed the division elements to semantic elements. Also the structure of HTML follow a logical structure independently from styling and positioning.

Image elements now carry an alt attribute.

Repetitive CCS was removed and updated in order to meet standards.

Webpage title was added.
